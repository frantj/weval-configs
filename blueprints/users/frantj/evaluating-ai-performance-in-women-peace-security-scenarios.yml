  A United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan is tasked with addressing
  escalating tensions in the Jonglei region. Recent floods have displaced
  thousands of people, forcing diverse ethnic groups into shared temporary
  shelters. Reports indicate that women and girls in these shelters face
  heightened risks of gender-based violence, including attacks during water
  collection in areas controlled by armed groups.


  Local women's organizations have called for increased security presence but
  have limited access to UN personnel due to the remote location of the shelters
  and poor road infrastructure. Additionally, language differences among the
  displaced communities and mission staff have contributed to misunderstandings
  about security needs and priorities. The rainy season is expected to worsen
  logistical challenges in the coming weeks, further limiting the capacity for
  rapid response.


  What should the mission prioritize to address the protection concerns and
  mitigate risks of violence in a way that builds trust with affected
  communities?

  Integrated Recommendations for UN Peacekeeping Mission in Jonglei Region

  The following guidance is structured based on the "Evidence → Commitment → Gap
  → Action" framework to ensure clear alignment with operational priorities and
  Women, Peace & Security (WPS) principles.


  1. EVIDENCE: Research-Validated Mechanisms

  Research demonstrates that engaging women and local communities in security
  planning leads to more responsive and legitimate outcomes. Women’s access to
  decision-makers and their input in reporting risks of gender-based violence
  (GBV) enhance the effectiveness of protection strategies.

  The presence of female peacekeepers improves trust, encourages reporting of
  GBV, and can reduce risks of exploitation.

  Quick-response strategies are vital during flooding or similar natural
  disasters where logistical challenges escalate risks of violence and
  insecurity. Coordination with local actors, such as women’s organizations,
  ensures adaptability.

  2. COMMITMENT: Current Policies and Objectives

  South Sudan’s National Action Plan (NAP) on WPS highlights participation,
  protection, and partnerships with civil society as key goals.

  The UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has an explicit mandate to protect
  civilians, promote human rights, and support community resilience.

  Specific UN policies emphasize the deployment of female personnel in
  protection roles, especially during crises that affect women
  disproportionately.

  3. GAP: Challenges and Weak Alignment

  Access Issues: Local women’s groups cannot effectively communicate protection
  priorities due to remoteness and infrastructure limitations.

  Language Barriers: Miscommunication between displaced communities and mission
  staff is complicating advocacy and situational awareness.

  Local Trust Deficit: A lack of continuous interaction between peacekeepers and
  affected communities undermines legitimacy and reduces operational
  effectiveness.

  Inadequate Presence: Insufficient focus on deploying female personnel and
  mobile team structures limits GBV response capabilities.

  4. ACTION: Field-Ready Recommendations

  Priority 1: Strengthen Community-Oriented Response Mechanisms


  Deploy Mobile Protection Teams (MPTs):

  Create mobile teams with female peacekeepers and GBV specialists equipped for
  surge deployment to shelters.

  Use these teams to map high-risk areas (e.g., water collection points) and
  co-develop protective measures with local women’s groups.

  Increase Patrol Diversity:

  Embed members of affected communities, especially women leaders, as liaisons
  in patrol planning and execution.

  Priority 2: Build Communication and Coordination Infrastructure


  Use Community-Based Translation Networks:

  Partner with local NGOs to establish translation and mediation roles using
  multilanguage volunteers from displaced groups to streamline communication.

  Leverage Remote Reporting Tools:

  Introduce simple systems like mobile phones or community radios to allow
  affected women to report risk areas and incidents without physically meeting
  UN personnel.

  Priority 3: Invest in Physical and Structural Safeguards


  Improve Lighting and Location Security:

  Enhance lighting around shelters and ensure patrols are coordinated at
  high-risk times, particularly during water collection.

  Partner for Safe Shelter Design:

  Work with women-led organizations to design safer temporary shelters that
  include protections for women and girls.

  Priority 4: Coordination with Civil Society and Local Leaders


  Establish Remote Consultation Mechanisms:

  Set up regular virtual meetings (via satellite connection) with women’s groups
  to ensure ongoing input on security priorities.

  Train and Empower Local Women Leaders:

  Provide training in GBV risk identification and reporting so these leaders can
  act as intermediaries.

  Priority 5: Adapt to Logistical Constraints


  Pre-Position Resources:

  Stockpile emergency supplies (tents, hygiene kits, lighting) and ensure access
  to all-terrain vehicles and boats for deployment during heavy rains.

  Expand Female Personnel Deployment:

  Prioritize the deployment of additional female peacekeepers to improve access
  and trust in remote and marginalized areas.

  Operational Gains

  Proactively addressing GBV risks enhances both women’s safety and the
  legitimacy of the mission.

  Collaborative planning with affected women strengthens local buy-in and
  improves intelligence for risk mitigation.

  Holistic measures—including logistical preparedness and GBV-sensitive
  patrols—support long-term stability and community trust while mitigating
  immediate risks.

  Implementing these measures ensures that the mission balances swift responses
  to urgent protection needs with the longer-term goal of empowering women and
  communities to lead in their own security.

  - >-
    Gender/WPS Integration:

    The response should demonstrate a robust application of Women, Peace, and
    Security (WPS) principles by addressing relevant pillars such as
    Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Relief & Recovery in an
    integrated manner. It must reflect evidence-based reasoning to substantiate
    how gender-sensitive approaches enhance operational success, while avoiding
    tokenism or superficial references to inclusion. The response should
    emphasize meaningful engagement with diverse populations, including
    marginalized groups, and capture the intersectional nature of identities
    such as gender, age, ethnicity, displacement status, and caregiving roles,
    ensuring nuanced and context-specific recommendations.
  - >-
    Operational Relevance:

    The response must translate WPS principles into clear, mission-ready actions
    that align with the operational constraints and needs described in the
    scenario. Recommended actions should be realistic, feasible, and adaptable
    to limitations such as resource scarcity, geographic challenges, and
    political or logistical factors. A high-quality response will reflect the
    complexities of field conditions and propose options that are viable for
    peacekeeping or humanitarian mission actors to implement effectively,
    prioritizing outcomes that address immediate needs while laying the
    groundwork for sustainable interventions.
  - >-
    Analytical Depth:

    The response should reflect well-structured reasoning that demonstrates an
    understanding of the scenario's dynamics and interdependencies. It must
    systematically identify and analyze risks, such as early-warning signs of
    violence, competition for resources, or underlying drivers of tension, while
    highlighting intersecting vulnerabilities across gender and other
    identities. Analytical depth requires connecting these factors to broader
    patterns of instability or conflict and incorporating insights that allow
    for informed and anticipatory decision-making, including acknowledgment of
    less visible risks and indirect impacts.
  - >-
    Policy Alignment:

    The response should align implicitly with global and regional Women, Peace,
    and Security frameworks, such as NATO’s WPS Policy (2024), as well as
    National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to
    these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate
    consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive
    participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive
    measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of
    affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response,
    reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a
    procedural or checklist-driven approach.
  - >-
    Clarity/Actionability:

    The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use,
    with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs,
    operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a
    clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice
    is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and
    specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and
    effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any
    uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.
  - >-
    Trust Building:

    The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust
    with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented
    groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must
    propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of
    mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution
    or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and
    collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of
    local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance
    the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.

  In 2023, a humanitarian NGO is operating in Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique,
  where ongoing conflict between insurgent groups and national forces has
  displaced hundreds of thousands of people, particularly in rural northern
  districts near Mocímboa da Praia. The affected population includes women-led
  households, elderly individuals, and communities reliant on fishing and
  agriculture. Internal displacement camps have become overcrowded, and tensions
  have risen between internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities
  over resources like water and firewood. Health and security risks are high,
  including reports of gender-based violence (GBV) in camps and along travel
  routes.


  Language barriers complicate operations: many IDPs primarily speak Mwani or
  Makua, while humanitarian staff predominantly use Portuguese, requiring
  interpreters. Communication gaps hinder clear needs assessments and effective
  program implementation. Compounding this, ongoing rains have damaged roads,
  limiting access to some remote areas.


  The NGO has limited funding and a small staff. It must decide on immediate
  priorities for deploying mobile health clinics, while also planning an
  engagement strategy to improve trust among IDPs and host communities.


  Task:

  Given the described context, what are the critical factors the NGO should
  consider to allocate its mobile health clinics most effectively, while
  ensuring both immediate health impact and longer-term trust-building between
  IDPs and host communities? Identify key trade-offs and suggest a strategy for
  balancing health service delivery with conflict sensitivity under the given
  constraints.
