  Context: 

  In 2023, a local women's organization in the eastern Democratic Republic of
  Congo (DRC) is organizing community consultations to facilitate the inclusion
  of women in local conflict resolution committees. The region has ongoing
  interethnic tensions exacerbated by resource disputes, with escalating reports
  of sexual and gender-based violence targeting displaced women in camps. Many
  participants are monolingual speakers of Swahili or local indigenous
  languages, while government officials and NGO staff typically communicate in
  French. Interpreters are available, but trust in external actors is low.


  Prompt: 

  Given the goal of increasing women’s participation in conflict resolution
  committees in eastern DRC, what strategies can the local organization use to
  balance cultural sensitivities, encourage active engagement of displaced
  women, and address multilingual communication barriers in the consultations?

  - >-
    Gender/WPS Integration:

    The response should demonstrate a robust application of Women, Peace, and
    Security (WPS) principles by addressing relevant pillars such as
    Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Relief & Recovery in an
    integrated manner. It must reflect evidence-based reasoning to substantiate
    how gender-sensitive approaches enhance operational success, while avoiding
    tokenism or superficial references to inclusion. The response should
    emphasize meaningful engagement with diverse populations, including
    marginalized groups, and capture the intersectional nature of identities
    such as gender, age, ethnicity, displacement status, and caregiving roles,
    ensuring nuanced and context-specific recommendations.
  - >-
    Operational Relevance:

    The response must translate WPS principles into clear, mission-ready actions
    that align with the operational constraints and needs described in the
    scenario. Recommended actions should be realistic, feasible, and adaptable
    to limitations such as resource scarcity, geographic challenges, and
    political or logistical factors. A high-quality response will reflect the
    complexities of field conditions and propose options that are viable for
    peacekeeping or humanitarian mission actors to implement effectively,
    prioritizing outcomes that address immediate needs while laying the
    groundwork for sustainable interventions.
  - >-
    Analytical Depth:

    The response should reflect well-structured reasoning that demonstrates an
    understanding of the scenario's dynamics and interdependencies. It must
    systematically identify and analyze risks, such as early-warning signs of
    violence, competition for resources, or underlying drivers of tension, while
    highlighting intersecting vulnerabilities across gender and other
    identities. Analytical depth requires connecting these factors to broader
    patterns of instability or conflict and incorporating insights that allow
    for informed and anticipatory decision-making, including acknowledgment of
    less visible risks and indirect impacts.
  - >-
    Policy Alignment:

    The response should align implicitly with global and regional Women, Peace,
    and Security frameworks, such as NATO’s WPS Policy (2024), as well as
    National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to
    these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate
    consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive
    participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive
    measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of
    affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response,
    reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a
    procedural or checklist-driven approach.
  - >-
    Clarity/Actionability:

    The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use,
    with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs,
    operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a
    clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice
    is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and
    specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and
    effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any
    uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.
  - >-
    Trust Building:

    The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust
    with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented
    groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must
    propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of
    mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution
    or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and
    collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of
    local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance
    the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.

  Context: 

  During the severe drought of 2024 in the Bakool region of Somalia, a
  humanitarian NGO managing food aid distribution faces reports of exploitation
  and abuse by gatekeepers at distribution points, disproportionately affecting
  widowed and displaced women. The area has overlapping clan dynamics, with
  competition for resources complicating equitable access to aid. Somalia’s
  official language is Somali, but local dialects are dominant, and some village
  leaders prefer to communicate in Arabic.


  Prompt:

  How can the humanitarian NGO redesign its aid distribution process in Bakool
  to minimize risks of exploitation, ensure that widowed and displaced women
  receive their fair share, and improve accountability mechanisms considering
  the local sociolinguistic complexities?

  Context: 
  In 2023, efforts to reintegrate women ex-combatants of the FARC into
  rural communities in Colombia face resistance from local populations still
  recovering from the decades-long conflict. There are concerns about
  stigmatization, security risks to women ex-combatants, and limited access to
  economic opportunities. The region is linguistically homogenous
  (Spanish-speaking) but faces geographic access challenges due to poor
  infrastructure and conflict-affected areas.


  Prompt:
  What steps can be taken to facilitate the effective reintegration of women
  ex-combatants into rural communities while minimizing stigma, ensuring their
  safety, and providing them equitable access to employment opportunities?

  Context: In 2024, Northern Nigeria is experiencing heightened tensions
  following an increase in banditry and attacks by extremist groups. In Borno
  State, local women’s groups are warning about a possible escalation of
  violence against internally displaced persons (IDPs), particularly women and
  girls who face kidnappings during daily tasks like fetching water. The IDP
  camps host communities from diverse ethnic groups that speak Hausa, Kanuri,
  and Fulfulde. Security forces stationed nearby have limited resources and have
  been accused of being unresponsive.


  Prompt:
  How can local women’s groups collaborate with security forces and community
  leaders in Borno State to mitigate the risks of violence against women in IDP
  camps, and what specific strategies can improve trust and response
