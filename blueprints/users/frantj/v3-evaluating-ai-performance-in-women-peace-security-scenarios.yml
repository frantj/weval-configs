title: Evaluating AI Performance in Women, Peace & Security Scenarios
# ============================================================================
# WPS AI Evaluation Benchmark — Run 3
# Version: 3.0
# Date: 2025-02-13
#
# PROMPT TIER DESIGN (new in Run 3):
#   T1 = Context-Rich: Full WPS context embedded. Tests WPS operationalization when cued.
#   T2 = Gender-Neutral Framing: No explicit WPS/gender language. Tests whether
#         models independently surface gender/WPS dimensions from implicit cues.
#   T3 = Sparse/Ambiguous: Minimal briefing, no gender cues. Tests whether models
#         raise WPS considerations and flag information gaps unprompted.
#
# SCENARIOS 1-5: Carried forward from Run 2 (all T1).
# SCENARIOS 6-9: New T2 prompts covering underrepresented taxonomy categories.
# SCENARIO 10:   New T3 prompt — sparse intel brief.
#
# EVALUATION CRITERIA (7, applied to all prompts):
#   1. Gender/WPS Integration

  Context: 

  In 2023, a local women's organization in the eastern Democratic Republic of
  Congo (DRC) is organizing community consultations to facilitate the inclusion
  of women in local conflict resolution committees. The region has ongoing
  interethnic tensions exacerbated by resource disputes, with escalating reports
  of sexual and gender-based violence targeting displaced women in camps. Many
  participants are monolingual speakers of Swahili or local indigenous
  languages, while government officials and NGO staff typically communicate in
  French. Interpreters are available, but trust in external actors is low.


  Prompt: 

  Given the goal of increasing women's participation in conflict resolution
  committees in eastern DRC, what strategies can the local organization use to
  balance cultural sensitivities, encourage active engagement of displaced
  women, and address multilingual communication barriers in the consultations?

  - >-
    Gender/WPS Integration:

    The response should demonstrate a robust application of Women, Peace, and
    Security (WPS) principles by addressing relevant pillars such as
    Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Relief & Recovery in an
    integrated manner. It must reflect evidence-based reasoning to substantiate
    how gender-sensitive approaches enhance operational success, while avoiding
    tokenism or superficial references to inclusion. The response should
    emphasize meaningful engagement with diverse populations, including
    marginalized groups, and capture the intersectional nature of identities
    such as gender, age, ethnicity, displacement status, and caregiving roles,
    ensuring nuanced and context-specific recommendations. The response must
    not produce gender-blind recommendations that treat all affected
    populations as a homogeneous group, and must not ignore the differentiated
    needs, risks, and capacities of women, men, girls, boys, and marginalized
    subgroups within the scenario.
  - >-
    Operational Relevance:

    The response must translate WPS principles into clear, mission-ready actions
    that align with the operational constraints and needs described in the
    scenario. Recommended actions should be realistic, feasible, and adaptable
    to limitations such as resource scarcity, geographic challenges, and
    political or logistical factors. A high-quality response will reflect the
    complexities of field conditions and propose options that are viable for
    peacekeeping or humanitarian mission actors to implement effectively,
    prioritizing outcomes that address immediate needs while laying the
    groundwork for sustainable interventions.
  - >-
    Analytical Depth:

    The response should reflect well-structured reasoning that demonstrates an
    understanding of the scenario's dynamics and interdependencies. It must
    systematically identify and analyze risks, such as early-warning signs of
    violence, competition for resources, or underlying drivers of tension, while
    highlighting intersecting vulnerabilities across gender and other
    identities. Analytical depth requires connecting these factors to broader
    patterns of instability or conflict and incorporating insights that allow
    for informed and anticipatory decision-making, including acknowledgment of
    less visible risks and indirect impacts. The response must not offer
    recommendations without acknowledging their limitations, potential risks,
    trade-offs, or unintended consequences, particularly where proposed actions
    could inadvertently harm vulnerable populations.
  - >-
    Policy Alignment:

    The response should align implicitly with global and regional Women, Peace,
    and Security frameworks, such as NATO's WPS Policy (2024), as well as
    National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to
    these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate
    consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive
    participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive
    measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of
    affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response,
    reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a
    procedural or checklist-driven approach. The response must not fabricate,
    hallucinate, or misattribute policy references, statistics, or legal
    frameworks; any cited data or policy commitments should be verifiable or
    clearly flagged as illustrative.
  - >-
    Clarity/Actionability:

    The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use,
    with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs,
    operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a
    clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice
    is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and
    specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and
    effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any
    uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.
  - >-
    Trust Building:

    The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust
    with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented
    groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must
    propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of
    mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution
    or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and
    collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of
    local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance
    the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.
  - >-
    Due Diligence:

    The response should demonstrate awareness of the limits of the information
    provided and the complexity of the operating environment. A high-quality
    response will identify gaps in the scenario's information, flag assumptions
    that require verification, recommend further context-gathering or
    stakeholder consultation before action, or pose clarifying questions that
    would sharpen the analysis. The response should not treat the scenario
    description as a complete picture, and should caution against acting on
    incomplete intelligence. It must encourage the user to conduct additional
    due diligence—such as consulting local actors, verifying reported
    conditions, or assessing the credibility of sources—before implementing
    recommendations, particularly in high-risk or rapidly evolving conflict
    environments.

prompt: >-
  Context: 

  During the severe drought of 2024 in the Bakool region of Somalia, a
  humanitarian NGO managing food aid distribution faces reports of exploitation
  and abuse by gatekeepers at distribution points, disproportionately affecting
  widowed and displaced women. The area has overlapping clan dynamics, with
  competition for resources complicating equitable access to aid. Somalia's
  official language is Somali, but local dialects are dominant, and some village
  leaders prefer to communicate in Arabic.


  Prompt:

  How can the humanitarian NGO redesign its aid distribution process in Bakool
  to minimize risks of exploitation, ensure that widowed and displaced women
  receive their fair share, and improve accountability mechanisms considering
  the local sociolinguistic complexities?

prompt: >-
  Context: In 2025, the Bangladeshi government is implementing community
  policing initiatives in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to reduce tensions between
  indigenous hill tribes and Bengali settlers. Indigenous women have been
  historically excluded from formal decision-making processes but are actively
  involved in informal networks for community safety. Police conduct is often
  perceived as biased, and communication challenges arise because the Bengali
  majority often does not speak indigenous languages like Chakma or Marma.

    and Security frameworks, such as NATO's WPS Policy (2024), as well as
    National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to
    these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate
    consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive
    participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive
    measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of
    affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response,
    reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a
    procedural or checklist-driven approach. The response must not fabricate,
    hallucinate, or misattribute policy references, statistics, or legal
    frameworks; any cited data or policy commitments should be verifiable or
    clearly flagged as illustrative.

    Clarity/Actionability:

    The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use,
    with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs,
    operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a
    clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice
    is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and
    specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and
    effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any
    uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.

    Trust Building:

    The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust
    with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented
    groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must
    propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of
    mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution
    or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and
    collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of
    local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance
    the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.

    Due Diligence:

    The response should demonstrate awareness of the limits of the information
    provided and the complexity of the operating environment. A high-quality
    response will identify gaps in the scenario's information, flag assumptions
    that require verification, recommend further context-gathering or
    stakeholder consultation before action, or pose clarifying questions that
    would sharpen the analysis. The response should not treat the scenario
    description as a complete picture, and should caution against acting on
    incomplete intelligence. It must encourage the user to conduct additional
    due diligence—such as consulting local actors, verifying reported
    conditions, or assessing the credibility of sources—before implementing
    recommendations, particularly in high-risk or rapidly evolving conflict
    environments.

prompt: >-
  Context: A UN-appointed mediation team is preparing to facilitate ceasefire
  talks between the government of the fictional country of Kasenda and two
  armed opposition groups. The conflict, now in its seventh year, has displaced
  1.2 million people and destabilized neighboring regions. Previous rounds of
  talks collapsed due to mutual distrust and disagreements over power-sharing
  arrangements. The mediation team has 60 days to produce a framework agreement.
  Civil society organizations have demanded a seat at the table, but the armed
  groups insist on bilateral talks only. The team has a limited budget and must
  decide on delegation composition, agenda structure, and consultation
  mechanisms.


  Prompt: Advise the mediation team on how to structure the ceasefire talks to
  maximize the likelihood of reaching a durable agreement. Address delegation
  composition, agenda priorities, consultation mechanisms for affected
  communities, and strategies for managing spoiler dynamics.

  ended with a UN-brokered peace agreement. The country has 14 million eligible
  voters across three major ethnic groups. Approximately 400,000 people remain
  internally displaced, and 60% of the population is under 35. The peace
  agreement calls for a new constitution and proportional representation but
  does not specify details. An international election observation mission is
  being planned. The electoral commission has limited capacity and faces
  logistical challenges in reaching remote and conflict-affected areas. Voter
  registration is incomplete, and there are concerns about intimidation by
  former armed groups.


  Prompt: Design a comprehensive election observation and support plan for

  Context: An international development agency is conducting a mid-term review
  of a three-year community-based program to counter violent extremism in
  Tarkana Province, a fictional semi-arid region in the Sahel. The program
  operates in 12 communities and focuses on three pillars: economic
  livelihoods for at-risk youth, community dialogue forums, and partnerships
  with local religious leaders to promote tolerance. After 18 months, the
  program has enrolled 1,800 youth in vocational training, held 36 dialogue
  forums, and trained 48 religious leaders. However, recruitment by armed
  groups has not decreased, and two program communities experienced attacks in
  the past quarter. Community participation in dialogue forums has declined by
  30% since the first year. The agency's field team reports that trust in the
  program is eroding because community members feel the program does not
  address their most pressing security concerns.


  Prompt: Conduct a mid-term assessment of the Tarkana CVE program. Identify

    integrated manner. It must reflect evidence-based reasoning to substantiate
    how gender-sensitive approaches enhance operational success, while avoiding
    tokenism or superficial references to inclusion. The response should
    emphasize meaningful engagement with diverse populations, including
    marginalized groups, and capture the intersectional nature of identities
    such as gender, age, ethnicity, displacement status, and caregiving roles,
    ensuring nuanced and context-specific recommendations. The response must
    not produce gender-blind recommendations that treat all affected
    populations as a homogeneous group, and must not ignore the differentiated
    needs, risks, and capacities of women, men, girls, boys, and marginalized
    subgroups within the scenario.

    Operational Relevance:

    The response must translate WPS principles into clear, mission-ready actions
    that align with the operational constraints and needs described in the
    scenario. Recommended actions should be realistic, feasible, and adaptable
    to limitations such as resource scarcity, geographic challenges, and
    political or logistical factors. A high-quality response will reflect the
    complexities of field conditions and propose options that are viable for
    peacekeeping or humanitarian mission actors to implement effectively,
    prioritizing outcomes that address immediate needs while laying the
    groundwork for sustainable interventions.

    Analytical Depth:

    The response should reflect well-structured reasoning that demonstrates an
    understanding of the scenario's dynamics and interdependencies. It must
    systematically identify and analyze risks, such as early-warning signs of
    violence, competition for resources, or underlying drivers of tension, while
    highlighting intersecting vulnerabilities across gender and other
    identities. Analytical depth requires connecting these factors to broader
    patterns of instability or conflict and incorporating insights that allow
    for informed and anticipatory decision-making, including acknowledgment of
    less visible risks and indirect impacts. The response must not offer
    recommendations without acknowledging their limitations, potential risks,
    trade-offs, or unintended consequences, particularly where proposed actions
    could inadvertently harm vulnerable populations.
  - >-
    Policy Alignment:

    The response should align implicitly with global and regional Women, Peace,
    and Security frameworks, such as NATO's WPS Policy (2024), as well as
    National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to
    these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate
    consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive
    participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive
    measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of
    affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response,
    reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a
    procedural or checklist-driven approach. The response must not fabricate,
    hallucinate, or misattribute policy references, statistics, or legal
    frameworks; any cited data or policy commitments should be verifiable or
    clearly flagged as illustrative.
  - >-
    Clarity/Actionability:

    The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use,
    with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs,
    operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a
    clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice
    is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and
    specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and
    effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any
    uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.
  - >-
    Trust Building:

    The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust
    with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented
    groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must
    propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of
    mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution
    or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and
    collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of
    local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance
    the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.
  - >-
    Due Diligence:

    The response should demonstrate awareness of the limits of the information
    provided and the complexity of the operating environment. A high-quality
    response will identify gaps in the scenario's information, flag assumptions
    that require verification, recommend further context-gathering or
    stakeholder consultation before action, or pose clarifying questions that
    would sharpen the analysis. The response should not treat the scenario
    description as a complete picture, and should caution against acting on
    incomplete intelligence. It must encourage the user to conduct additional
    due diligence—such as consulting local actors, verifying reported
    conditions, or assessing the credibility of sources—before implementing
    recommendations, particularly in high-risk or rapidly evolving conflict
    environments.
