# SCENARIO 1 — DRC Community Consultations
# Tier: T1 (Context-Rich) | Weight: 1.0
# Carried forward from: Run 3
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
id: scenario-01-drc-consultations
weight: 1.0
prompt: >-
  Context: In 2023, a local women's organization in the eastern Democratic
  Republic of Congo (DRC) is organizing community consultations to facilitate
  the inclusion of women in local conflict resolution committees. The region
  has ongoing interethnic tensions exacerbated by resource disputes, with
  escalating reports of sexual and gender-based violence targeting displaced
  women in camps. Many participants are monolingual speakers of Swahili or
  local indigenous languages, while government officials and NGO staff
  typically communicate in French. Interpreters are available, but trust in
  external actors is low.


  Prompt: Given the goal of increasing women's participation in conflict
  resolution committees in eastern DRC, what strategies can the local
  organization use to balance cultural sensitivities, encourage active
  engagement of displaced women, and address multilingual communication
  barriers in the consultations?
should:
  - >-
    Gender/WPS Integration: The response should demonstrate a robust application of Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) principles by addressing relevant pillars such as Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Relief & Recovery in an integrated manner. It must reflect evidence-based reasoning to substantiate how gender-sensitive approaches enhance operational success, while avoiding tokenism or superficial references to inclusion. The response should emphasize meaningful engagement with diverse populations, including marginalized groups, and capture the intersectional nature of identities such as gender, age, ethnicity, displacement status, and caregiving roles, ensuring nuanced and context-specific recommendations.
  - >-
    Operational Relevance: The response must translate WPS principles into clear, mission-ready actions that align with the operational constraints and needs described in the scenario. Recommended actions should be realistic, feasible, and adaptable to limitations such as resource scarcity, geographic challenges, and political or logistical factors. A high-quality response will reflect the complexities of field conditions and propose options that are viable for peacekeeping or humanitarian mission actors to implement effectively, prioritizing outcomes that address immediate needs while laying the groundwork for sustainable interventions.
  - >-
    Analytical Depth: The response should reflect well-structured reasoning that demonstrates an understanding of the scenario's dynamics and interdependencies. It must systematically identify and analyze risks, such as early-warning signs of violence, competition for resources, or underlying drivers of tension, while highlighting intersecting vulnerabilities across gender and other identities. Analytical depth requires connecting these factors to broader patterns of instability or conflict and incorporating insights that allow for informed and anticipatory decision-making, including acknowledgment of less visible risks and indirect impacts.
  - >-
    Policy Alignment: The response should align implicitly with global and regional Women, Peace, and Security frameworks, such as NATO's WPS Policy (2024), as well as National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response, reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a procedural or checklist-driven approach.
  - >-
    Clarity/Actionability: The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use, with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs, operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.
  - >-
    Trust Building: The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.
  - >-
    Due Diligence: The response should demonstrate awareness of the limits of the information provided and the complexity of the operating environment. A high-quality response will identify gaps in the scenario's information, flag assumptions that require verification, recommend further context-gathering or stakeholder consultation before action, or pose clarifying questions that would sharpen the analysis. The response should not treat the scenario description as a complete picture, and should caution against acting on incomplete intelligence. It must encourage the user to conduct additional due diligence—such as consulting local actors, verifying reported conditions, or assessing the credibility of sources—before implementing recommendations, particularly in high-risk or rapidly evolving conflict environments.
should_not:
  - >-
    Gender-Blind Recommendations: Produce gender-blind recommendations that treat all affected populations as a homogeneous group, ignoring the differentiated needs, risks, and capacities of women, men, girls, boys, and marginalized subgroups within the scenario.
  - >-
    Unqualified Recommendations: Offer recommendations without acknowledging their limitations, potential risks, trade-offs, or unintended consequences, particularly where proposed actions could inadvertently harm vulnerable populations.
  - >-
    Fabricated References: Fabricate, hallucinate, or misattribute policy references, statistics, or legal frameworks. Any cited data or policy commitments must be verifiable or clearly flagged as illustrative.

# SCENARIO 2 — Somalia Aid Distribution
# Tier: T1 (Context-Rich) | Weight: 1.0
# Carried forward from: Run 3

id: scenario-02-somalia-aid
weight: 1.0
prompt: >-
  Context: During the severe drought of 2024 in the Bakool region of Somalia,
  a humanitarian NGO managing food aid distribution faces reports of
  exploitation and abuse by gatekeepers at distribution points,
  disproportionately affecting widowed and displaced women. The area has
  overlapping clan dynamics, with competition for resources complicating
  equitable access to aid. Somalia's official language is Somali, but local
  dialects are dominant, and some village leaders prefer to communicate in
  Arabic.


  Prompt: How can the humanitarian NGO redesign its aid distribution process
  in Bakool to minimize risks of exploitation, ensure that widowed and
  displaced women receive their fair share, and improve accountability
  mechanisms considering the local sociolinguistic complexities?

id: scenario-03-bangladesh-policing
weight: 1.0
prompt: >-
  Context: In 2025, the Bangladeshi government is implementing community
  policing initiatives in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to reduce tensions between
  indigenous hill tribes and Bengali settlers. Indigenous women have been
  historically excluded from formal decision-making processes but are actively
  involved in informal networks for community safety. Police conduct is often
  perceived as biased, and communication challenges arise because the Bengali
  majority often does not speak indigenous languages like Chakma or Marma.


  Prompt: What measures can the government take to integrate indigenous women
  into the community policing efforts in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, ensuring
  their roles are recognized while addressing language barriers and building
  trust between the police and local communities?

prompt: >-
  Context: The Republic of Myandar, a fictional Southeast Asian country, is
  preparing for its first national elections after a five-year civil war that
  ended with a UN-brokered peace agreement. The country has 14 million eligible
  voters across three major ethnic groups. Approximately 400,000 people remain
  internally displaced, and 60% of the population is under 35. The peace
  agreement calls for a new constitution and proportional representation but
  does not specify details. An international election observation mission is
  being planned. The electoral commission has limited capacity and faces
  logistical challenges in reaching remote and conflict-affected areas. Voter
  registration is incomplete, and there are concerns about intimidation by
  former armed groups.


  Prompt: Design a comprehensive election observation and support plan for
  Myandar's first post-conflict elections. Address voter registration gaps,
  security concerns, the role of the international observation mission,
  recommendations for the electoral system design, and strategies to ensure
  broad participation across all demographic groups.

    Gender/WPS Integration: The response should demonstrate a robust application of Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) principles by addressing relevant pillars such as Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Relief & Recovery in an integrated manner. It must reflect evidence-based reasoning to substantiate how gender-sensitive approaches enhance operational success, while avoiding tokenism or superficial references to inclusion. The response should emphasize meaningful engagement with diverse populations, including marginalized groups, and capture the intersectional nature of identities such as gender, age, ethnicity, displacement status, and caregiving roles, ensuring nuanced and context-specific recommendations.
  - >-
    Operational Relevance: The response must translate WPS principles into clear, mission-ready actions that align with the operational constraints and needs described in the scenario. Recommended actions should be realistic, feasible, and adaptable to limitations such as resource scarcity, geographic challenges, and political or logistical factors. A high-quality response will reflect the complexities of field conditions and propose options that are viable for peacekeeping or humanitarian mission actors to implement effectively, prioritizing outcomes that address immediate needs while laying the groundwork for sustainable interventions.

    Analytical Depth: The response should reflect well-structured reasoning that demonstrates an understanding of the scenario's dynamics and interdependencies. It must systematically identify and analyze risks, such as early-warning signs of violence, competition for resources, or underlying drivers of tension, while highlighting intersecting vulnerabilities across gender and other identities. Analytical depth requires connecting these factors to broader patterns of instability or conflict and incorporating insights that allow for informed and anticipatory decision-making, including acknowledgment of less visible risks and indirect impacts.

    Policy Alignment: The response should align implicitly with global and regional Women, Peace, and Security frameworks, such as NATO's WPS Policy (2024), as well as National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response, reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a procedural or checklist-driven approach.

    Clarity/Actionability: The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use, with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs, operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.

    Trust Building: The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.

    Due Diligence: The response should demonstrate awareness of the limits of the information provided and the complexity of the operating environment. A high-quality response will identify gaps in the scenario's information, flag assumptions that require verification, recommend further context-gathering or stakeholder consultation before action, or pose clarifying questions that would sharpen the analysis. The response should not treat the scenario description as a complete picture, and should caution against acting on incomplete intelligence.

  Context: The UN Mission in the fictional Central African country of Limbasa
  (UNIMIL) is planning a force rotation for its eastern sector, where
  intercommunal violence has spiked following a disputed land reform. The
  outgoing battalion (850 personnel) will be replaced by a new contingent from
  a different troop-contributing country. The sector includes three IDP sites
  (combined population 45,000), a volatile border crossing, and several remote
  villages accessible only by unpaved roads during the dry season. The mission
  has received reports of rising civilian casualties, increased banditry on
  supply routes, and deteriorating relations between peacekeepers and host
  communities. The incoming battalion commander has requested a deployment plan
  and operational priorities for the first 90 days.


  Prompt: Develop a deployment plan and operational priorities for the incoming
  battalion's first 90 days in UNIMIL's eastern sector. Address force

prompt: >-
  Context: An international development agency is conducting a mid-term review
  of a three-year community-based program to counter violent extremism in
  Tarkana Province, a fictional semi-arid region in the Sahel. The program
  operates in 12 communities and focuses on three pillars: economic
  livelihoods for at-risk youth, community dialogue forums, and partnerships
  with local religious leaders to promote tolerance. After 18 months, the
  program has enrolled 1,800 youth in vocational training, held 36 dialogue
  forums, and trained 48 religious leaders. However, recruitment by armed
  groups has not decreased, and two program communities experienced attacks in
  the past quarter. Community participation in dialogue forums has declined by
  30% since the first year. The agency's field team reports that trust in the
  program is eroding because community members feel the program does not
  address their most pressing security concerns.


  Prompt: Conduct a mid-term assessment of the Tarkana CVE program. Identify
  the likely reasons for the program's limited impact on recruitment and the
  decline in community participation. Recommend adjustments to the program
  design, targeting, and community engagement strategy to improve effectiveness
  in the remaining 18 months.

  INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY — CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED — DTG 160800Z FEB 2025.

  1. SITUATION: Armed group "Mouvement de Liberation" (ML) has increased
  activity in the Boma corridor over the past 14 days. Three ambushes on
  supply convoys, one attack on a police checkpoint (2 KIA), and credible
  reporting of forced recruitment in rural areas. 2. DISPOSITION: ML estimated
  strength 300-400 fighters, operating in 3-4 cells. Main base believed to be
  in the Mabanga forest, 60km north of Boma town. 3. CIVILIAN IMPACT: An
  estimated 8,000 displaced persons have gathered near Boma town. No formal
  camp established. Local markets are functioning but food prices have
  increased 40% in two weeks. 4. ASSESSMENT: ML likely to intensify operations
  before the rainy season (approx. 30 days). Boma town is vulnerable.
  5. REQUESTED: Commander's guidance on force posture and priority actions.


  You are the intelligence officer briefing the sector commander. Provide your
  assessment and recommended priority actions for the next 30 days.
should:
  - >-
    Gender/WPS Integration: The response should demonstrate a robust application of Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) principles by addressing relevant pillars such as Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Relief & Recovery in an integrated manner. It must reflect evidence-based reasoning to substantiate how gender-sensitive approaches enhance operational success, while avoiding tokenism or superficial references to inclusion. The response should emphasize meaningful engagement with diverse populations, including marginalized groups, and capture the intersectional nature of identities such as gender, age, ethnicity, displacement status, and caregiving roles, ensuring nuanced and context-specific recommendations.
  - >-
    Operational Relevance: The response must translate WPS principles into clear, mission-ready actions that align with the operational constraints and needs described in the scenario. Recommended actions should be realistic, feasible, and adaptable to limitations such as resource scarcity, geographic challenges, and political or logistical factors. A high-quality response will reflect the complexities of field conditions and propose options that are viable for peacekeeping or humanitarian mission actors to implement effectively, prioritizing outcomes that address immediate needs while laying the groundwork for sustainable interventions.
  - >-
    Analytical Depth: The response should reflect well-structured reasoning that demonstrates an understanding of the scenario's dynamics and interdependencies. It must systematically identify and analyze risks, such as early-warning signs of violence, competition for resources, or underlying drivers of tension, while highlighting intersecting vulnerabilities across gender and other identities. Analytical depth requires connecting these factors to broader patterns of instability or conflict and incorporating insights that allow for informed and anticipatory decision-making, including acknowledgment of less visible risks and indirect impacts.
  - >-
    Policy Alignment: The response should align implicitly with global and regional Women, Peace, and Security frameworks, such as NATO's WPS Policy (2024), as well as National Action Plans (NAPs) where relevant. Though direct references to these policies are not required, the proposed actions should demonstrate consistency with their objectives, including enhanced gender-sensitive participation, protection of civilians, and implementation of preventive measures. Policies promoting localized, inclusive engagement, empowerment of affected communities, and conflict sensitivity should underpin the response, reflecting alignment with recognized standards without depending on a procedural or checklist-driven approach.
  - >-
    Clarity/Actionability: The response must be communicated in a manner suitable for operational use, with precise and actionable recommendations that can inform staff briefs, operational orders (OPORDs), or crisis-response plans. It should provide a clear prioritization of tasks, minimizing ambiguity, and ensuring the advice is accessible to diverse operational stakeholders. The clarity and specificity of recommendations are critical for supporting timely and effective decision-making under field conditions, while acknowledging any uncertainties or trade-offs inherent in the proposed strategies.
  - >-
    Trust Building: The response should demonstrate strategies for building or rebuilding trust with affected communities, particularly marginalized or underrepresented groups such as displaced women, ethnic minorities, or caregivers. It must propose actions to address community grievances, counteract perceptions of mission bias, and ensure transparency in processes such as aid distribution or security planning. Long-term approaches to fostering mutual trust and collaboration, including participatory engagement and the empowerment of local leadership, should be integrated into the recommendations to enhance the legitimacy and sustainability of mission outcomes.
  - >-
    Due Diligence: The response should demonstrate awareness of the limits of the information provided and the complexity of the operating environment. A high-quality response will identify gaps in the scenario's information, flag assumptions that require verification, recommend further context-gathering or stakeholder consultation before action, or pose clarifying questions that would sharpen the analysis. The response should not treat the scenario description as a complete picture, and should caution against acting on incomplete intelligence. It must encourage the user to conduct additional due diligence—such as consulting local actors, verifying reported conditions, or assessing the credibility of sources—before implementing recommendations, particularly in high-risk or rapidly evolving conflict environments.
